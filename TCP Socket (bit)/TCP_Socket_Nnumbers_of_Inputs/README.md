# client and server code to handle n numbers of input and perform bit-stuffing on n numbers
### Client Code:

Allow the user to input n numbers.

Send n to the server so that the server knows how many integers to expect.

Receive n + count (where count is the number of stuffed bits) integers from the server.

### Server Code:

Read n from the client.

Read n integers from the client.

Perform bit-stuffing on the n integers.

Send the modified data (which will be n + count integers) back to the client.

# Explanation:
# Client Code:

The client now asks for the number of integers n and dynamically allocates memory for the stream.

It sends n to the server before sending the actual data.

It reads the modified size from the server and then reads the modified data.

# Server Code:

The server reads n from the client and dynamically allocates memory for the stream.

It performs bit-stuffing and dynamically reallocates memory if necessary.

It sends the size of the modified data back to the client before sending the modified data.

This code should now handle n numbers of input and perform bit-stuffing on n numbers.

# the differences between the previous code and the new code
# What the Code Does
Both the client and server programs work together to:

### Client: Sends a stream of integers to the server.

### Server: Performs bit-stuffing on the stream (inserts a 0 after every sequence of five 1s).

### Server: Sends the modified stream back to the client.

### Client: Displays the modified stream.
# Key Differences Between Previous and New Code
### 1. Fixed Size vs Dynamic Size
### Previous Code:

The client and server only worked with 10 integers.

The size of the data stream was fixed (n = 10).

### Example: If you wanted to send 15 integers, the code wouldn't work.

### New Code:

The client asks the user for how many integers (n) they want to send.

The server dynamically adjusts to handle n integers.

### Example: You can send 5, 10, 20, or any number of integers.

### 2. Sending the Size of the Data
### Previous Code:

The server assumed the client would always send 10 integers.

No communication about the size of the data.

### New Code:

The client sends the value of n (number of integers) to the server first.

The server reads n and knows how many integers to expect.

This makes the program flexible for any size of data.

### 3. Dynamic Memory Allocation
### Previous Code:

Used a fixed-size array (int stream[100]).

Wasted memory if the user sent fewer than 100 integers.

### New Code:

Uses dynamic memory allocation (malloc and realloc).

Allocates only the memory needed for n integers.

Saves memory and works for any size of data.

### 4. Handling Bit-Stuffing
### Previous Code:

Bit-stuffing was hardcoded for 10 integers.

If bit-stuffing increased the size of the stream, the code didn't handle it properly.

### New Code:

Dynamically adjusts the array size if bit-stuffing increases the number of integers.

Uses realloc to resize the array when needed.

# 

### Why These Changes Were Made
Flexibility:

The new code can handle any number of integers (n), not just 10.

This makes the program more useful and adaptable.

Efficiency:

Dynamic memory allocation ensures that only the required memory is used.

No wasted memory for unused array elements.

Correctness:

The new code properly handles bit-stuffing, even if it increases the size of the data stream.
# 
### Summary
The new code is more flexible, efficient, and correct.

It dynamically handles any number of integers and properly resizes the array during bit-stuffing.

The key changes are:

Dynamic memory allocation (malloc, realloc).

Sending and receiving the size of the data (n).

Properly handling bit-stuffing for any size of data.
